# InfiniteMonkeyTheorem-GeneticAlgorithm
- This is my approach on solving ***Infinite Monkey Theorem*** using **Java** and **[Processing](https://processing.org/)**
- To run this on your computer you need to download **Processing** from **[here](https://processing.org/download/)** and open the project in **Eclipse**. Go to **src** and make sure you open **UsingProcessing.java** and then hit run.

# Infinite Monkey Theorem
- The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).
     
# Genetic Algorithm
- A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

- Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.
1. **Initial population**
2. **Fitness function**
3. **Selection**
4. **Crossover**
5. **Mutation**
